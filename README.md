# React Image Lazy Load
- Based on [window.IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
## Description
This package created for the lazy loading images
- Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.
- Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.
- Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.

You can play with it in [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/fragrant-paper-2bwoy?file=/src/App.js)
